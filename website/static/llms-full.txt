# NEAR Protocol Documentation - Full Reference

## Overview
NEAR is the unified commerce layer for assets and agents. It's a layer-1 blockchain built for scale (13M+ transactions/day, 5 years zero downtime) that enables AI agents to own accounts, sign transactions across any blockchain, and execute trades through an intent-based system.

### Core Pillars
1. **Universal Trading Protocol (Intents)**: Intent-based transactions where users express desired outcomes and solvers compete to execute optimally
2. **Confidential AI Infrastructure (NEAR AI)**: AI agents with on-chain identity that can control assets and transact autonomously
3. **Secure Infrastructure (Protocol)**: Battle-tested L1 with sharded architecture, account abstraction, and cross-chain capabilities
4. **Governance (House of Stake)**: Community-driven governance model
5. **Economics**: Sustainable tokenomics and developer incentives

## Chain Abstraction

### What is Chain Abstraction?
Chain abstraction makes blockchain complexity invisible to users while preserving all benefits. NEAR's framework enables developers to build cross-chain applications using three core technologies:

1. **NEAR Intents**: Express desired outcomes, solvers handle execution
2. **Chain Signatures**: Control accounts on any blockchain from NEAR
3. **OmniBridge**: Secure cross-chain asset transfers

**Resources:**
- Main guide: /chain-abstraction/what-is
- NEAR Intents: /chain-abstraction/intents/overview
- Chain Signatures: /chain-abstraction/chain-signatures/getting-started
- Meta Transactions: /chain-abstraction/meta-transactions

### NEAR Intents
NEAR Intents let users express what they want, not how to do it. Instead of executing complex multi-chain transactions yourself, you submit an intent (like "swap Token A for Token B at the best price") and a decentralized network of solvers (market makers and AI agents) compete to fulfill it optimally.

**How it works:**
1. User/agent submits intent expressing desired outcome
2. Solvers (market makers, AI agents) compete to provide best solution
3. Winner presents quote for approval
4. On approval, Verifier contract on NEAR executes and settles

**Key differences from traditional transactions:**
- Intents: Express outcome → Solvers optimize and execute → Low complexity
- Traditional: Specify every step → User executes → High complexity (manage gas, bridges, DEXs)

**Use cases:**
- Token swaps across chains at best price
- Cross-chain DeFi operations
- NFT purchases
- Real-world services (powered by solver network)

### Chain Signatures
Chain Signatures enable NEAR accounts (including smart contracts) to sign and execute transactions on other blockchains using Multi-Party Computation (MPC).

**Key capabilities:**
- Single NEAR account controls multiple blockchain accounts
- Write contracts on NEAR that interact with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Base, etc.
- Decentralized MPC with no single point of failure
- Supports UTXO (Bitcoin) and account-based (Ethereum) models

**Supported chains:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, Base, and any chain with signature verification

### Meta Transactions (Gasless Transactions)
Meta transactions let users transact without paying gas fees while maintaining security. A relayer (web service with funded NEAR account) receives signed transactions from users and submits them on-chain, covering gas costs.

**How it works:**
- User signs transaction (maintains security)
- Relayer submits to blockchain (pays gas)
- User doesn't need NEAR tokens

**Preventing abuse:**
- Whitelist specific contracts
- Set gas allowances per account
- Require OAuth tokens
- Use multiple keys to prevent nonce collisions

**Resources:**
- Building a relayer: /chain-abstraction/meta-transactions
- Rust relayer server: https://github.com/near/pagoda-relayer-rs/

## AI Native Infrastructure

### Overview
NEAR enables User-Owned AI through frameworks that allow AI agents to control blockchain accounts and execute on-chain actions autonomously.

**Key frameworks:**
1. **Shade Agents**: Verifiable, non-custodial, multichain AI agents in TEEs
2. **NEAR AI**: Agent network infrastructure with monetization

**Resources:**
- Getting started: /ai/introduction
- Shade Agents: /ai/shade-agents/getting-started/introduction
- NEAR AI docs: https://docs.near.ai

### Shade Agents
Shade Agents are AI agent frameworks to create verifiable agents that can control accounts across multiple blockchains with assurance that the agent cannot lose access and private keys will never be revealed.

**Key features:**
- Operate in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
- Decentralized key management (any agent instance with same code can access same accounts)
- Non-custodial (no single point of failure)
- Multichain support (Bitcoin, Ethereum, NEAR, etc.)

**Capabilities:**
- Autonomously sign transactions across chains
- Interact with AI models and external data
- Manage assets
- Privacy-preserving verifiable computations

**Use case:** Agentic Protocols - decentralized applications designed to be autonomous, proactive, and intelligent

### NEAR AI
NEAR AI builds agent network infrastructure to support User-Owned Agents:
- Monetizable open-source AI agents
- Agent-to-agent communication
- End-to-end confidential iterations

**Access:** NEAR AI Assistant (chat.near.ai/chat) - single interface that intelligently selects appropriate agents and connects them for complex tasks

**Which framework to choose:**

  network: "testnet",
  modules: [/* wallet modules */]
});
```

## Common Developer Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I deploy a contract?**
A: Use `near deploy <account-id> <wasm-file>` via NEAR CLI

**Q: Which language should I use?**
A: JavaScript/TypeScript for rapid prototyping, Rust for production, Python/Go for specific use cases

A: Use Chain Signatures to control accounts on Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. from NEAR

**Q: What is an intent?**
A: User expresses desired outcome (e.g., "swap Token A for B at best price"), solvers compete to execute

**Q: How do meta transactions work?**
A: User signs transaction, relayer submits and pays gas. User maintains security without needing tokens.
